Anything Declared outside the scope can be changed inside the scope and also accessible, but cannot again be
declared inside the scope.
Anything declared inside the scope cannot be accessed outside the scope, but can be decalred again outside the scope
only after the scope of the block has finished.

Ex:- 
{
int a = 10;
{
	int a = 20;//compiler error, because the scope of outside a is not finised yet. 
}
}

But,

{
{
int a = 10;
}
int a = 10; //valid because the scope of the first a is finished inside the scope
}
