In Java, there is no such thing as pass by reference.
When we pass a variable through a method. It will create a new variable that will point towards the same
object. So changing the value of that new variable wont have any effect for the original variable. Because
when we change that new variable it will just point towards a new object, and the old variable will keep pointing
towards the old object.

Ex:-

psvm(){
   String name = "Shibshankar"
   greet(name);
   Sout(name);
}
greet(naam){
naam = "Shivshankar"
}

Changing the new variable in the greet method wont have any effect on the old variable because by doing so
we are just creating a new object and the new variable will just point towards the new object.
